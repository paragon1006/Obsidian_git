#### HDD working
- The hard disk has one or more platters made of aluminium or glass
- Each surface Of the platter/disk is ferrous-oxide which is capable Of being magnetised
- The platters/disks are mounted on a central spindle
- The disks are rotated at high-speed
- Each surface of the disk has a read/write head mounted on an arm positioned just above the surface
- Electronic circuits control the movement of the arm and hence the heads
- The surface of the platter/disk is divided into concentric tracks and sectors
- One track in one sector is the basic unit of storage called a block
- The data is encoded as a magnetic pattern for each block
- When writing to disk, a variation in the current in the head produces a variation in magnetic field on the disk
- When reading from disk, a variation in magnetic field produces a variation in current through the head

## Laser Printer 
#### LP print cycle
1. Laser beam and a rotating mirror are used to draw an image of the page on the photosensitive drum
2. 
## Inkjet Printer
#todo inkjets
### Piezoelectric
### Thermal bubble
# 3D printer
- Uses CAD

# Speakers
### Parts of a speaker:
1. Diaphragm/Cone
2. (Voice) Coil of wire
3. Spider/Suspension
4. Permanent Magnet
5. Basket
6. Dust Cap
7. Outer Frame

### Working of a speaker:
1. Takes an electrical signal and translates it into physical vibrations to create sound waves
2. An electric current in the coil creates an electro-magnetic field
3. Changes in the audio signal causes the direction of the electric current to change
4. The direction of the current determines the polarity of the electro-magnet // changing the direction of the current changes the direction of the polarity of the electro-magnet
5. The electro-magnet is repelled by or attracted to the permanent magnet causing the coil to vibrate
6. The movement of the coil causes the cone / diaphragm to vibrate
7. That vibration is transmitted to the air in front of the cone / diaphragm as sound waves 
8. The amount of movement will determine the frequency and amplitude of the sound wave produced
