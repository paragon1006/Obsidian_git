# Speakers
### Parts of a speaker:
1. Diaphragm/Cone
2. (Voice) Coil of wire
3. Spider/Suspension
4. Permanent Magnet
5. Basket
6. Dust Cap
7. Outer Frame

### Working of a speaker:
1. Takes an electrical signal and translates it into physical vibrations to create sound waves
2. An electric current in the coil creates an electro-magnetic field
3. Changes in the audio signal causes the direction of the electric current to change
4. The direction of the current determines the polarity of the electro-magnet // changing the direction of the current changes the direction of the polarity of the electro-magnet
5. The electro-magnet is repelled by or attracted to the permanent magnet causing the coil to vibrate
6. The movement of the coil causes the cone / diaphragm to vibrate
7. That vibration is transmitted to the air in front of the cone / diaphragm as sound waves 
8. The amount of movement will determine the frequency and amplitude of the sound wave produced
