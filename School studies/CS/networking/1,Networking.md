 | LAN                                | WAN                                                         | MAN                                       |
 | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
 | Local                              | Wide                                                        | Metropolitan                              |
 | Small network, usually in building | Can use public communications like phonelines or satellites | Limited to geographical areas like cities |
 | Example device: printer            | Might be private, requiring psswd&id to access              | Like university campus                    |
 | Usually 1 building at most         | It can cover continents                                     | Within cities/universities                |
 |                                    |                                                             |                                           |

## Network Architecture
![network|300*300](Network_architectures.png)
Client server: - 1 server to which many clients connect and get controlled by
Peer to Peer:- each computer has equal rights

## Network Topology
3 topologies:
### _Bus topology:_

## Cloud Network
![network|300*600](Cloud.png)
Stores your data in many places

## Transmission media
2 Types:

guided | unguided
-- | --
Co-axial | 
Twisted Pair| Radio waves
Fibre Optic | Micro waves
### Twisted pair
2 types
shielded and unshielded
(shield used to prevent interception)
