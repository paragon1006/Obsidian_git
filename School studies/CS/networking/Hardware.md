### ROM ROM
- ROM - Read Only Memory
- PROM - Programable Read Only Memory
	- Found in mobiles/RFID
	- Matrix of fuses
	- Can be changed once
- EPROM - Erasable Programable Read Only Memory
	- Found in game consoles under development
	- Transistors and Capacitors
	- requires UV light to modify
	- can be changed once
- EEPROM - Electronically Erasable Read only Memory
