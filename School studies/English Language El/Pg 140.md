## Answer
Dear Diary,
It is a perplexing concoction of feelings that run frantically in my head. It's a new start, a fresh start but it requires me to let go of a part of myself. My friends at school, my friends in the block. My whole life running away from me, as I try to catch it, it turns into dust in my very hands going further and further away from me, too far to reach. Yet, even in this endlessly dark room, waiting for me is a small beacon of hope. A chance to live again, make new friends as my old ones fade into memory, make new memories in a new house. Another place I can call home sweet home, but a doubt lurks in a corner of my mind. Will it ever be the same? Will it ever be, home? 

It is a sad task recounting the many farewells from today. It began with a glum morning, I was barely able to get some sleep last night, thoughts of the new house kept me awake. I began my day no different than every other. Awaiting my presence were my friends. Friends I may never see again, because I was going away, leaving my home, my country. As we shed our tears and bid adieu, I wanted to disappear into a corner and be forgotten but with all my courage I fought this urge to hide and stood my ground as I saw my friends for what could be the last time. After they left I returned to my room and prepared myself mentally for my last look at my house. I gazed upon my house for one last time. The movers looted our house to ship our possessions, now the house lay empty now. We left for the airport with our air of sadness surrounding us. I decided to sleep over the fifteen hour flight recovering my lack of sleep from the night before. I read my book, Scrolled through memories and eventually slept too.  

The journey from the immigration to the new house was exciting our mood lightened in the wait to see the new house. The new house was... Incredible! It had beautiful surroundings with an amazing backyard. My room was huge with a really tall ceiling and an mind-blowing view of the Swiss alps.

It is a truly beautiful house, But can I call it home?
