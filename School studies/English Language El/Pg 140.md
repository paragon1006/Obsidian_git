# Question 1
Your family has recently moved to a new and unfamiliar place. That night, you write your diary, reflecting on the day's events and conveying your outlook and mood. Write your diary entry, using no more than 400 words.


## Answer 1
Dear Diary,
It is a perplexing concoction of feelings that run frantically in my head. It's a new start, a fresh start but it requires me to let go of a part of myself. My friends at school, my friends in the block. My whole life running away from me, as I try to catch it, it turns into dust in my very hands going further and further away from me, too far to reach. Yet, even in this endlessly dark room, waiting for me is a small beacon of hope. A chance to live again, make new friends as my old ones fade into memory, make new memories in a new house. Another place I can call home sweet home, but a doubt lurks in a corner of my mind. Will it ever be the same? Will it ever be, home? 

It is a sad task recounting the many farewells from today. It began with a glum morning, I was barely able to get some sleep last night, thoughts of the new house kept me awake. I began my day no different than every other. Awaiting my presence were my friends. Friends I may never see again, because I was going away, leaving my home, my country. As we shed our tears and bid adieu, I wanted to disappear into a corner and be forgotten but with all my courage I fought this urge to hide and stood my ground as I saw my friends for what could be the last time. After they left I returned to my room and prepared myself mentally for my last look at my house. I gazed upon my house for one last time. The movers looted our house to ship our possessions, now the house lay empty now. We left for the airport with our air of sadness surrounding us. I decided to sleep over the fifteen hour flight recovering my lack of sleep from the night before. I read my book, Scrolled through memories and eventually slept too.  

The journey from the immigration to the new house was exciting our mood lightened in the wait to see the new house. The new house was... Incredible! It had beautiful surroundings with an amazing backyard. My room was huge with a really tall ceiling and an mind-blowing view of the Swiss alps.

It is a truly beautiful house, But can I call it home?

# Question 2

### Answer 2
Respected Editor,
As students, children of my age are educated of the immense danger posed by the rise of plastics in various industries. Therefore I, Progun Damani am writing to you regarding the increasing use of plastic packaging where it is needed in our hometown of {insert name}. It is truly heart breaking to see plastic packaging overflowing in our dustbins, it floods our streets like an overflowing river and plagues the bodies of the animals who mistake it for food. 
One of the key contributors to the issue of the excess plastic are business in industries such as those of food and drink. Be it the straw used for sipping coffee or the plastic bag used to carry home groceries, plastics are everywhere in the industry. Yet as people become more and more aware industry giants make small shifts such as paper straws and biodegradable plates. However smaller business are reluctant to change, they prefer following their older traditions and serving their many dishes surrounded by plastics. The wrappers from the food then end up overfilling the bins and get thrown on the streets. The cherry on top is that many of the dishes and drinks contain citric acids or hot substance which leeches chemicals from the containers or surrounding plastics. These leeched chemicals eventually find their way to the stomachs of the unsuspecting people consuming the food unaware of it's carcinogenic consequences. 
Accompanying the chemicals is a swarm of microplastics which lodge themselves in the villi (structures used for food absorption in the small intestine). This blocks the process of digestion which creates many health issues and blocks nutrient absorption, these small microplastics also take very long to get rid of and may remain in the body for several more years. 
Often when these chemicals and microplastics are in the body for long periods of time it leads to detrimental damage to health leading to even cancers in the digestive track
Another key contributor to the plastics issue are the relatively simple to get rid off plastic bags, while easily replaceable businesses are difficult to persuade towards alternatives such as jute or other biodegradables. 
Education is the biggest factor in change, a newspaper such as {insert name} could spread the word far and wide in the city and create a wave of change for a healthier and happier {insert name}, and pave way for a better future.
