The boat floated in the rough seas as a feather gets knocked around by air. The waves rocked the boat to and fro, again and again, unrelenting battering as wave after wave crash into the small wooden boat. It's mast fell within the first hour of the storm, the sailors were stolen by the sea by hour three, picked off one after one by the wicked waves. The boat lay empty, holding off the endless beating of the waters with sheer determination as the rope held the wood together while being pelted by the seas. 

The pitter patter of rain pounding on the water and wood echoed in the stormy seas. Thunder rung overhead like canons booming in sky. The clouds wailed and bawled, their tears pattered onto the stormy seas. The rumbling thunder cracked in the sky, it's echoes intensified as if gunshots were fired in the air. The wind screeched through army of droplets racing to join the water below, howling into the air. The wooden boat creaked and shrieked as the waves blasted into it with a roaring crash. The sound of distant waves rising and smashing into the ocean sounded like bombs 
exploding in the distance, and their shock waves rocking the boat.

Bright lights flashed in the sky, bright as a star. It lit up the sky as a lamp would a dark cave, revealing the clouds for only a moment. A moment too long the clouds drooped low in the sky the dark contrast of the blinding darkness against the clouds light up by thunder painted the sky in gloomy shades of grey. When the lightning fell to the ground it lit up not just the sky, but the waves too. Like the tentacles of a kraken the waves rose to smash all in their way. The leviathan waves were tipped with white foam and painted a dark grey-green. Striking not just the boat, but all the fell under it's path of fury. 

As the storm raged on, the boat continued to be battered by the waves. The thunder and lightning provided brief glimpses of the ocean below, but the darkness between these flashes quickly swallowed up any sense of safety. The boat creaked and groaned under the strain, its mast having snapped off and its hull beginning to leak. Despite its efforts to stay afloat, it was clear that the boat was soon going to join it's crew beneath the waves.
