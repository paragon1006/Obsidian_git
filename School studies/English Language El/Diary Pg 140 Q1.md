## Answer
Dear Diary,
It's a perplexing concoction of feelings that run frantically in my head. It's a new start, a fresh start but it requires me to let go of a part of myself. My friends at school, my friends in the block. My whole life running away from me, as I try to catch it, it turns into dust in my very hands going further and further away from me, too far to reach. Yet, even in this endlessly dark room, waiting for me is a small beacon of hope. A chance to live again, make new friends as my old ones fade into memory, make new memories in a new house. Another place I can call home sweet home, but a doubt lurks in a corner of my mind. Will it ever be the same? Will it ever be like, home?
